Evaluate Rundeck as an effective user interface on top of existing Java command line / server programs

Rundeck - https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck describes itself as

Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console, command line tools and a WebAPI. It lets you easily run automation tasks across a set of nodes.

The scope of this project is to prototype Rundeck as being effectively used as a user interface / API interface on top of an existing Java commandline and server program. The existing Java program is https://github.com/distributev/mailmerger

mailmerger is composed of 2 parts

* a command line which takes some input parameters and does some normal processing and also generates info.log and errors.log outputs
* a server program which "wraps" the same processing as the command line but in an "automated" polling (server) way of execution - the same info.log and errors.log are generated by the server also
Both mailmerge command line and mailmerge server take as input CSV files and generate PDF output files. mailmerge server once started is continuously polling a "poll" folder for new CSV files to be processed - once new CSV files are dropped into the "poll" folder (configurable) the CSV files are automatically picked and processed to generate the output PDF files.

Using rundeck build a simple user interface which will allow users:

1. to browse and select local CSV files to be uploaded to the "poll" folder which is watched by the existing mailmerge-server
2. once new CSV files are uploaded automatically pick and "wrap" the existing processing using the http://rundeck.org/docs/api/ ==> the existing mailmerge processing will be "wrapped" as rundeck jobs
3. once the jobs are processed using rundeck apis allows users to see the output of the jobs inside the user interface. For instance the users should be able to see a simple list with the CSV jobs they triggered along with the status which could be "green success" or "red errors"
4. Once clicking on each individual job in the list of previously executed jobs ==> a job details page should open which will display, in the case of successful job, a list with the individual PDFs generated (along with a link to view / download each PDF) and in the case of error the job details should display the errors.log specific to the current job execution (users should be able to see for what reason the specific job failed).
